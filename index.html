											<p>I come from Indonesia, Surabaya province to be exact. My province detail might sound trivial for most, but for those who have at the very least slight knowledge of my nation would know that it really is not. Indonesia is comprised of many provinces, each with their own unique culture. Sometimes, these cultures could be drastically different to one another, hence its importance. As for my province's culture, it is normal for people to speak loudly and sometimes a little straightforward, especially toward people that they know. Some people, even from other province, might take this as a sign of aggression, but most of the time it is just a misunderstanding.
											 That said, I am quite the oddball in term of that specific culture, so don't expect me to be anything like that.</p>
											<p>I do, or to be more precise, my family have several pets (two dogs and two turtle) which they keep at my home in my country. One of which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever"> golden retriever</a> that is aggressive (but not hostile) toward people</p>

								<p>This website is recruiting for the position of software developer, mainly in programmer position as the requirements leans heavily on it. This job position looks very appealing for me as I am highly fond of programming. Moreover, the company also provide a mentor to help which would be useful in gaining skills and experience. In order to secure a place in said job position, one has to complete an undergraduate degree in Information Technology (software), strong results for academic study, experience with object-oriented development language and communication skills. Currently, I have several experience in Java and some degree of communication skills, especially writing. My current plan to be able to secure the vacancy of the job is to focus on my study as it is explicitly stated that the company would want to recruit people with high academic results.</p>

						<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="Interest">
								<h2 class="major"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
								<p>My interest in IT is mostly on programming, but also extend to some other general things, such as how the computer works. I started to have an interest in IT when I was in the elementary school, where I discovered robotic lessons. It was not until high school that I realised that it seems to be that I do better in subjects concerning IT, hence my interest. My experiences in IT are those that I got from elementary to high school along with what I learnt from foundation studies at RMIT.
								 This include networking (cisco), programming (c programming) and using some general applications, such as microsoft word, excel, powerpoint, adobe photoshop and more.</p>
								<p>There are some reasons as to why I chose to study at RMIT. In general, I chose it because it is located in Australia. As Australia is considered a developed country, studying (and graduating) from here is considered prestigious. Some of my family also live here, which would make my stay here a lot more convenient. As for my reason to why I chose specifically RMIT, it is simply because I got a recommendation from an agent.
								 During my study here, I expect to learn knowledge that are crucial for IT fields and might be useful for future references, such as networking and new language for programming. </p>

								<h3><b><u>Reflection</u></b></h3>
								<p>The result of the tests shows that I rather do a work that requires less communication and more thinking. I also tend to visualize what I just heard or think, which could help to verify the logic behind it. I also have a tendency to plan everything I do and will do to and self-adjust as necessary. As such, in a team, I would be likely to give less but well thought out recommendations in discussions. I will also plan all the works given to me as to provide punctual delivery. When forming a team, I would consider words that I would use to introduce myself and try to give my best first impression to the members of the team.</p>

						<!-- Project Ideas -->
							<article id="Ideas">
								<h2 class="major"><strong>Project Ideas</strong></h2>

								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>The project that comes up in my mind is a (mobile) game involving simple physics. The objective of this game is to simply have a ball (or any other object) to not touch the ground of the stage as long as possible with given tools (platforms, etc.). There are some other thoughts that come in mind whilst I developed the ideas, such as other game modes/types or online aspect implementations. </p>
									
									
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>This idea comes up in my mind whenever I am outside and does not have anything to do, more particularly while waiting for something. Playing games on mobile phone seems to be the practical solution here, except when said mobile phone have limited amount of battery power and power socket might not be found. Moreover, some people cannot afford to buy or have a mobile phone that have the necessary specifications to run a certain game. While there are already many games that have taken these problems into account, none of them (as far as my research concerned) play exactly the same as my project idea. The game that is also simple compared to the other mobile games in the market, therefore only relatively little skill/experience needed to develop the game or the prototype of it.</p>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>Generally, this game has an objective of dropping a ball (or other kind of object applicable) until it reaches the ground of the stage within the time limit. This limit, however, is not an upper but instead lower limit (minimum not maximum). Therefore, players are given several “tools” that is in-game objects that would help them maintain the ball from falling to the ground before the time limit reached. These objects can be general objects, such as platforms, to the more complicated ones, such as gears. Note that the player could easily keep the ball from falling at all with even one platform, but this won’t complete the game’s objective which explicitly stated to have the ball reach the ground. As such, players are expected to slow down the fall of the ball whilst avoiding the ball itself to stuck. For this, the players would need to mind the physics around the stage and use them to their advantage. The stage itself could be modified for increased challenge in further stages. These include, but not limited to, limitation of tools, time limit, gravity, density of the ball and layout of the stage itself.</p>
									<p>The game does not need to end only with specified features. For instance, the game mode can be changed from reaching a certain time limit to distance or even height. This will, in turn, changes the game almost completely as the objective is now different. Naturally, this will also make the player to employ different strategies or approach. New items/tools could also be provided to the player to give convenience or to help them solve the stage as some objective might not be able to be completed using the original tools. Moreover, online features could be integrated in the game, which can be implemented in some ways. One of the most widely used features is high score. With this, players can post their best score, which form varied on the objective of the stage. This high score can be posted publicly to the “leaderboard” which can be seen publicly. The user can also choose to not publicly upload their score and instead save it locally in their device (which is usually the common protocol when the user does not upload their data). Additionally, a feature which lets players to make their own stage, which have been done some games such as Super Mario Maker, can be added. This will give the players an opportunity to share their creation across the platform and let others play and review it or privately uploaded to be able to be seen only by friends. Needless to say, this might be wrongly/irresponsibly used by some. As such, some anticipation would be needed should the feature be added, such as user’s ability to report certain stages uploaded online or manually check the database. Finally, it is important to note that while all these features are supposedly complementary, they will increase the game’s “replayability” by much, which is very crucial in the game industry.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>As stated before, this game is relatively simple compared to the general mobile games in the market. As such, tools and technologies utilised can be something with relatively low and simple specifications. Some fundamental tools and technologies that can be used are as follow: </p>
									<ul>
										<li><u>Program for making the game</u></li>
										<p>The tool for this particular game does not necessarily restricted to have the ability to handle large projects. The program that might be used are Unity, Construct2 or similar.</p>
										<li><u>Laptops or PC (Personal Computers)</u></li>
										<p>In addition to the software for creating the game, a hardware is also in order. Since the game requires little specifications, any laptop that support windows and can run emulators (should the testing does not use a mobile phone) would suffice. It is worth noting that the better the specifications are, the faster the game development will generally be.</p>
										<li><u>Smartphone or emulator</u></li>
										<p>A smartphone, preferably android, would be needed to test the product/prototype. Alternatively, an emulator could be used from laptops/PC instead of smartphone.</p>
									</ul>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Skills Required</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Understanding of programming language (language differs depending on the tool used) and skills (logical thinking, etc.)</li>
										<li>Basic designing skills in designing the in-game object</li>
									</ul>
								</section>

								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>With the low specifications for the game, this game would supposedly be a decent “time-killer” whilst consuming as little battery power as possible and provide accessibility to those who does not have mobile phones with high specifications. Should the product come out successfully, additional features can be added with users’ feedback in mind. As for the impact to the development team, more knowledge of programming language can be acquired, along with some other skills, such as designing and communication skills.</p>
